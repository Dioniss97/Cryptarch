# Domain Model

## Core rule
Tags are metadata only. Permissions come from saved filters and group bindings.

## Entities
- Tag (flat labels in phase 1)
- SavedFilter (target: user/action/document, tag AND logic)
- Group (binds user/action/document saved filters)
- User (role: admin or user; tagged; tenant-scoped)
- Connector (base URL + auth config; transitional semantic alias: Integration)
- Action (belongs to connector; method/path/request config; tagged; transitional semantic alias: IntegrationAction)
- Document (tenant file metadata; tagged; indexing status)

## Effective permissions
1. Find groups whose user filters match the user
2. Union actions from those groups' action filters
3. Union documents from those groups' document filters

## Multi-tenant rule
Every structured entity is tenant-scoped (`tenant_id`), and tenant filters are applied before permission filters.

## Future optimization
If joins get expensive, add precomputed permission tables recalculated on admin changes.
